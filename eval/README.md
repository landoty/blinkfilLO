# Evaluation Benchmarks

We evaluate BlinkFilLO using a subset of the `Transformation` set from the [Prose Benchmarks](git@github.com:microsoft/prose-benchmarks.git). Specifically, we choose benchmarks from this set which include *only* the "concatenation", "multicol", and "substring" features. This subset is representative of all the program types that the original BlinkFilLO supports.
